# TtrpgRumorDist

Theres a concept some people like using in their tabletop role playing games (such as Dungeons and Dragons) called rumors. A common version of rumors is everyone writes one good rumor one bad rumor and one false rumor and then these are given to the rest of the players. I am not sure how common it is, but I prefer only giving some of the rumors to each other player, so in that case each would get 2. This little program makes it so I don't have to think about who gets what rumor and it puts it in a nice copyable message!


## Running the program

Running this should be very simple assuming you already have Java ready IDE set up on your computer. Just build and run!

If you do not have a Java ready IDE, then you need to at least have Java so you can go into the src file in a terminal and run `javac Main.java` then `java Main`
